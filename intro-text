In this survey we wish to study computer markup languages as understood by people with little or no prior experience with programming. The survey will take approximately 15 minutes.

You will be asked to create and interpret visual typographical elements such as images, tables and lists, by using only plain text. Imagine that you have to write an email including such typographical constructs, but you are limited to use only the characters present on you keyboard. 

If you are unsure of how to do a specific exercise, please explain your interpretation of the given exercise in the free-text area.

We will store your IP-address and the amount of time you spend solving the exercises for stastistical purposes.
