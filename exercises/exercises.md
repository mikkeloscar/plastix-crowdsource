table, a list etc.), and then has to express this image using plain-text in a
text area.

(2) the participant is given a piece of code, and has to choose an image that
represents a rendering of that code best.

# COMMENTS

Two type 2 exercises for lists: not to rule any style out, and get feedback for both stylings.

No type 2 for sections: making a multiple choice for renderings for a sectioned text seems like a 
too simple exercise, and the results of this exercise would not inlighten us further.

Exercises about spacing omitted, since the inituively most readable method of producing spacing would be new lines (carriage returns) and regular white space (spaces). The only downside to this approach is consitently layouting throughout a document.
